# Licence Plate Detection using YOLO V8

This repository contains a project that implements a license plate detection system using YOLO V8, a state-of-the-art object detection model. The system is designed to accurately detect and recognize license plates in images.



## Project Description

The Licence Plate Detection project leverages the YOLO V8 model for detecting license plates in images. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a powerful and efficient object detection algorithm that performs detection in a single pass through the neural network, making it both fast and accurate.
